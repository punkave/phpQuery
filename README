This is phpQuery, a PHP port of jQuery selectors, super useful for DOM traversal 
and functional testing.

It is originally by Tobiasz Cudnik:

http://code.google.com/p/phpquery/

And was released under the MIT license.

We've cloned it into github because no issues have been fixed upstream in the 
last two years and we needed to fix a bug relating to the serialize()
method to get our functional tests to work. You can find our github
repository here:

https://github.com/punkave/phpQuery

"What did you fix?" 

Our initial commit includes a fix for the serialize() method, crucial to do 
form submissions (a big deal for functional testing). See the commit history
in github for any later changes.
